    <h1>Bits</h1>
    <p>
      bits! some small bytes! I am embarrassed for having said that. these are fun. they're not really meals on their own unless you're really low on groceries and you eat a whole head of cauliflower at once. but basically pick 1-3 bits and put them together and call it a meal.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>fake dig inn:</b> your bits & rice & toppings (avocado, edamame, sauce etc)</li>
      <li><b>dig inn but sadder:</b> your bits & bread</li>
      <li><b>""tacos"":</b> your bits & corn tortilla & rice & black beans & sauce (sriracha mayo!, franks, vegan avocado crema)</li>
      <li><b>fresh rolls:</b> cucumber + carrot + rice vermicelli + egg + peanut sauce</li>
      <li><b>fresh rolls when you don't want to make sauce:</b> honey soy tofu + cucumber + carrot + rice vermicelli</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>black beans, catu style:</b> cook some finely chopped garlic and onion in a saucepan, then dump in a can of beans and cook off the liquid. no extra salt needed</p>
