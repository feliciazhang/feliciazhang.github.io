    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
      to your veggie journey. When I originally planned this out I had actual things to say here, but obviously I had to gather the energy to do this for a few days so I've since forgotten. and after doing this i realize how few things i actually cook. but anyway very cool that you like vegetables and want to cook. this site is here really just to present to you my child, my pinterest board, so if you want to just get to it you can see her <a href='https://www.pinterest.com/16fyz/michelin/' target="_blank">here</a>. the uncatagorized pins are things I haven't actually tried yet, and make sure to read the comments on the pins. I've been told though that the board does not make sense to anyone but myself so alternatively, use the tabs on the left and I'll try to make it make sense. ((but what about protein?)) protein is a scam and you dont need as much as you think you do and it doesn't need to be from meat. bone apple tea and remember to buy cumin
